# Synchronizing StackBlitz with Local Project

This guide explains how to keep your StackBlitz project in sync with your local development environment.

## Option 1: Push Changes from StackBlitz to GitHub

Since you've already pushed the project to GitHub, the simplest approach is to continue using GitHub as the central repository:

1. Make changes in StackBlitz
2. Push those changes to GitHub
3. Pull the changes to your local environment

### Steps to Push from StackBlitz to GitHub:

1. In StackBlitz, connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
2. Use the GitHub integration to commit and push changes
3. On your local machine, run `git pull` to get the latest changes

## Option 2: Export from StackBlitz and Update Local Files

If you prefer a more direct approach without using GitHub:

1. In StackBlitz, click on "Project" in the top-left corner
2. Select "Download Project" to get a ZIP file of the current state
3. Extract the ZIP and copy the updated files to your local project

## Option 3: Manual File Synchronization

For specific files that have been modified:

1. Open the file in StackBlitz
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste it into the corresponding file in your local project

## Tracking Changes

Keep a log of which files have been modified in StackBlitz:

- src/App.tsx
- src/types/index.ts
- src/utils/mockData.ts
- src/utils/csvParser.ts
- src/components/AddUrlForm.tsx
- src/components/RankingTable.tsx

## Best Practices

- Make changes in one environment at a time to avoid conflicts
- Use version control (Git) whenever possible
- Document significant changes
- Test thoroughly after synchronizing
