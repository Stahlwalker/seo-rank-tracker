# StackBlitz Git Troubleshooting

## Common Issues with Git in StackBlitz

If you've already created a repository but don't see the Git icon in StackBlitz, try these solutions:

### Solution 1: Refresh the Page

Sometimes the Git integration doesn't load properly. Try refreshing the page to see if the Git icon appears.

### Solution 2: Check the Project Settings

1. Click on the "Project" button in the top-left corner
2. Select "Project Settings"
3. Look for any Git or GitHub related settings
4. Ensure your repository is properly connected

### Solution 3: Reconnect the Repository

1. Click on the "Connect Repository" button in the top-right corner
2. Select your existing repository from the list
3. Follow the prompts to reconnect

### Solution 4: Use the Command Palette

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the command palette
2. Type "git" to see available Git commands
3. Try using these commands directly instead of the Git icon

### Solution 5: Check Browser Console for Errors

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any errors related to Git or GitHub integration

## Alternative Approach: Manual Synchronization

If you can't get the Git integration working in StackBlitz, you can manually synchronize your changes:

1. Export your project from StackBlitz (Project > Download Project)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy the files to your local repository
4. Use Git commands locally to commit and push changes

## Contact StackBlitz Support

If none of these solutions work, you may want to contact StackBlitz support:

1. Click on the "?" icon in the bottom-left corner
2. Select "Report an issue"
3. Describe your problem with the Git integration
