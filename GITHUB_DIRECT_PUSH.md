# Pushing to GitHub Without StackBlitz Git Integration

If you're unable to use the Git integration in StackBlitz, you can still push your changes to GitHub using these alternative methods:

## Method 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have access to a terminal with GitHub CLI installed:

1. Export your project from StackBlitz (Project > Download Project)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder
3. Open a terminal in that folder
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update from StackBlitz"

# Add your GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub (you might need to use -f if histories don't match)
git push -u origin main
```

## Method 2: GitHub Web Interface

For smaller changes or individual files:

1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
2. Navigate to the file you want to update
3. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Paste the new content from StackBlitz
5. Scroll down and commit the changes

## Method 3: GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI application:

1. Export your project from StackBlitz
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Add the local folder as a repository
4. Commit the changes
5. Push to GitHub

## Method 4: Use Another Web IDE with Better Git Support

If you need to frequently push changes to GitHub, consider using an alternative web IDE with more reliable Git integration:

- GitHub Codespaces
- GitPod
- CodeSandbox

## Keeping Track of Changes

Regardless of which method you use, keep track of which files you've modified in StackBlitz to ensure you don't miss any changes when pushing to GitHub.
